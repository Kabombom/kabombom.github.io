###That part where I say something nobody cares about

Hey there, my name is Miguel I'm currently studying Computer Science at University of Coimbra. This blog was created to spend some time explaining the way I solve some simple problems using mainly C and Java. Will dive latter into some other languages like Python and Scala. Thinking of posting some random reviews on anime, not sure though.                     
If you like my blog, you can follow some of my school projects and side projects (not many projects at this time) at [@kabombom](https://github.com/kabombom).
