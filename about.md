###That part where I say something nobody cares about

Hey there, my name is Miguel I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at University of Coimbra. This blog was created to spend some time explaining the way I solve some simple problems using mainly C and Java. Will dive latter into some other languages like Python and Elixir. 
Thinking of posting some random reviews on anime.
